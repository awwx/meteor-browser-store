Testing
=======

Tests that a browser successfully communicates a local storage change
between iframes.

To run, change into this test directory, and start Meteor:

    $ mrt install
    $ mrt

and then open the browser you want to test on http://localhost:3000/.

The web page will initially say "Test status: testing", and then it
will change to "Test status: OK" if the test is successful.
